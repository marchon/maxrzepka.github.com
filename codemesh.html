This talk will describe the Grisp Project the port of Erlang to RTEMS.
RTEMS is a open-source hard-realtime operating system for small
embedded systems. It is used in the aerospace industry flying on
satellites and planetary probes - currently its also driving around on
Mars and on the Gallileo Satellites. Porting Erlang to RTEMS opens the
way to new application areas, like in the current use case a
intelligent RFID system for Industry 4.0 and Internet of Things
applications.

</ul>
<ul>
<li id="sec-1-2-1-2">Peer Stritzinger (@peerstr)<br/>
got bored with writing the second version
of his automotive flashing product in C again so he tried Erlang. 
After four weeks into the project there was no going back. 
That was in 2007, since then he is implementing a increasing
percentage of embedded systems code in Erlang. 
Initially mastered in Physics (Technical University Munich) Peer has
broad experience from low level device drivers to functional languages 
in industrial and automotive applications. 
He has worked self employed as developer since 1987 and since over 10
years as designer, 
developer and manufacturer of industrial products. 
He did consulting work in applied cryptography and protocol design and
implementation. 
Erlang is a natural fit for all these applications, so it was
inevitable for Erlang to become his favourite language. 
Peer is currently living and working in the nice countryside west of Munich, Bavaria.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2-2">


<p>
The introduction of Smalltalk in the mid 1970s ushered in a series of
thought experiments that would eventually popularize the object
oriented programming model with several of the most successful
languages of all time. At the peak of popularity, object oriented
programming in C++ and Java has changed the way we code, the way we
visualize problems, and even the way we think. Not all of the changes
have been for the better. This talk seeks to crystallize the problems
with the object oriented languages and programming model. It also will
explore specific ways that other languages remedy these problems.
We'll see anecdotes from in Java, Ruby, Scala, Clojure, Erlang, and
Haskell.
</p>
<p>
Talk objectives:
New language adoption is moving faster than it has at any point in the
last twenty years. This talk seeks to help us understand why. Learn
how current programming language evolution, by satisfying needs in the
marketplace, evolved. Attendees will better understand:
</p>
<ul>
<li>What characteristics made the most successful languages popular?

</li>
<li>What will modern languages need to succeed?

</li>
<li>What forces are pushing language designers today?
</li>
</ul>



<p>
Target audience:
</p><ul>
<li>A knowledge of object oriented programming concepts is helpful but
  not necessary. This talk will be helpful to programmers.
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="sec-1-3-2">Refactoring Functional Programs: Past and Future</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-2">


<p>
Refactoring is the process of modifying how a program works without
changing what it does. Functional programs, because of their lack of
(uncontrolled) side-effects, are particularly amenable to being
refactoring. We'll show this through a set of examples from Haskell
and Erlang, some of them implemented in our tools HaRe and Wrangler.
In the second part of the talk we'll look at how to take refactoring
of functional programs to the next level, and show some prototype
ideas we're working with.
To set out an agenda of future challenges for functional refactoring
over the next 10 years.
</p>
<p>
Talk objectives:
</p><ul>
<li>To convey what is distinctive about refactoring for functional
  programming;

</li>
<li>To communicate this through a collection of examples from Haskell
  and Erlang;

</li>
<li>To demonstrate the tools that we have built: HaRe and Wrangler;

</li>
<li>To set out an agenda of future challenges for functional refactoring
  over the next 10 years.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
Target audience:
</p><ul>
<li>Developers who work in functional languages, and researchers and
  engineers who build tools to help them.

<h4 id="sec-1-3-3">Julia: Fast Performance, Distributed Computing &amp; Multiple Dispatch</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-3">


<p>
Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic language carefully
designed to be excellent for technical computing. It has been gaining
traction as a an alternative to Matlab, R and NumPy – especially in
performance-critical areas such as machine learning, “big statistics”,
linear algebra and image analysis. But it's also a general purpose
language that you can use for anything from serving web pages to
writing games. This talk will explore some of Julia's unique design
features, especially how it maintains high-level ease-of-use, while
giving you performance and control traditionally only found in
low-level languages like C and Fortran. Another unusal feature is that
Julia's core paradigm is multiple dispatch: Julia programs are
organized around generic functions – first-class function objects to
which methods can be added, allowing them to operate on new data
types. Generic functions thus bridge the gap between object-oriented
and functional paradigms, allowign the notorious "expression problem"
to be solved in a particularly intuitive and elegant way. The talk
will include lots of live coding and demos of everything from data
analysis, to distributed computing, to defining new fast numeric
primitives.
</p>
<p>
Talk objectives:
The talk will start with a brief introduction to the Julia language:
the way it looks and feels, how and why it was designed the way it
was. It will continue with an introduction to the "expression problem"
and why it's important for writing composable, reusable software. It
will also provide examples of how to load and visualized data, and
trivially run a computation on a cluster of machines.
</p>
<p>
Target audience:
</p><ul>
<li>Anyone with an interest in and some knowledge of language design and
  data analysis – especially the intersection of the two.
</li>
</ul>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-4-1">


<p>
This lecture is an introduction to fault tolerant computing.
</p>
<p>
How can we make systems that are resilient to hardware and software
faults?
</p>
<p>
Systems can fail for a number of reasons, the hardware can fail or the
software can fail. In this lecture I'll talk about the foundations of
fault tolerant computation and the basic properties a system should
have in order to be able to function in an adequate manner despite the
occurrence of hardware and software errors.
</p>
<p>
We'll see how concurrency and scalability are intimately related to
fault tolerance and and take a quick peep at shared memory and message
passing concurrency.
</p>
<p>
I'll also summaries the key features of Erlang and show how they can
be used for programming fault-tolerant and scalable systems on
multi-core clusters.

<h4 id="sec-1-4-2">Functional Algebra by Example</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-4-2">


<p>
When we first discover functional programming, we learn to declare
what our programs should do (rather than how). We appreciate simpler
models for concurrency, and we get excited about its conciseness.
However, many developers with an Object Oriented (OO) background find
it hard to model richer domains in functional languages, or don't know
where to start. This hands-on talk will explore examples of using
algebraic abstractions to model various domains and show that this can
keep the developer closer to the domain and more focused on
functionality than boilerplate. Evolving code examples will be used to
explore the power of these abstractions with less formal emphasis of
exactly how the code maps back to algebraic concepts. Example code in
Scala, Haskell, and Erlang.
</p>
<p>
Talk objectives:
Provide motivating examples of domain modeling with algebraic
abstractions with algebraic data types.
</p>
<p>
Target audience:
Basic understanding of passing functions around as values and
willingness to revisit algebraic concepts. Typically OO or former OO
developers.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-4-3">


<p>
We have defined an API and built an open-source platform for dealing
with in-memory distributed data. We've used it to built
state-of-the-art predictive modeling and analytics (e.g. GLMNET, GBM,
Random Forest) that's 1000x faster than the disk-bound alternatives,
and 100x faster than R (we love R but it's tooo slow on big data!).
We're building our newest algorithms in a few weeks, start to finish,
because the platform makes Big Math easy. We routinely test on 100G
datasets, have customers using 200G datasets, and have lab tested even
more.
</p>
<p>
This talk is about a coding style &amp; API that lets us seamlessly deal
with datasets from 1K to 1TB without changing a line of code, lets us
use clusters ranging from your laptop to 50 server clusters with many
many TB of ram and hundreds of CPUs.
</p>
<p>
Talk objectives:
Learn about a platform &amp; API for doing in-memory analytics.
</p>
<p>
Target audience:
People who got data, and want to do fast predictive modeling and
analytics&hellip; or just need a platform that lets them code to Big Data
naturally.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-4-4">


<p>
As the industry awakens to the abuse of relational data modelling, the
graph datastore arises as a compelling choice for many data needs.
This may not be extremely obvious to those who have been raised in the
RDBMS era, for use beyond modelling social networks. Even if you
aren’t working at Facebook or in a similar space (or even with jvm
languages), there are many reasons you may want to look at a graph for
your data needs, specifically Neo4j.
</p>
<p>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-5-1">


<p>
What is the difference between a database query and drag-and-drop
event? The answer: nothing. They're both queries, and can be coded
using the exact same programming model. A newly discovered type has
given us new insight into the dual relationship between synchronous
and asynchronous programming. You'll be surprised to learn that the
sequence operations you already know (map, filter, reduce, merge, zip,
etc.) can to be used to build everything from GUIs to high
performance, non-blocking servers. Come see how Netflix uses
functional composition over this amazing new type to build reactive
multi-tier systems. You may never approach programming the same way
again.
</p>
<p>
Talk objectives:
</p><ul>
<li>Teach developers to think about events as collections. Demonstrate
  some basic collection operations that can be applied to both arrays
  and events. Use these collection operations together to express
  complex asynchronous programs as simple expressions.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-5-2">


<p>
Eventually Consistent Databases, like Riak, buy you a lot: highly
available, simple scaling, geo-replication: but the developer pays the
price, with little to no guarantees, and only folklore for data
modelling. This talk describes one weapon in the developers armoury:
CRDTs. A CRDT is Data Type that converges to a single, deterministic
value no matter how many replicas are modified concurrently. CRDTs
offer a principled approach to Eventually Consistent data modelling,
and greatly simplify the task of programming applications that use
Eventually Consistent Databases.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-5-4">


<p>
What's the best mental model for software construction? The prevailing
model draws heavily from physical construction. Terms like
architecture, foundation, plumbing &ndash; even "design" &ndash; come from our
history of building real structures like houses, roads, and bridges.
While they often dominate our thinking about software, should they?
Are there other models that are more helpful?
</p>
<p>
In this talk Garrett will argue that biology is a more useful model
for software construction. Understanding how organisms function and
evolve opens up thinking that's informed by the universe's most
complex and successful systems. Innovations like DNA, complex cells,
photosynthesis, sex and even death contain remarkably useful patterns
that we can apply in our day-to-day work as programmers.
</p>

Target Audience

<p>
If you're interested in the process of software construction, this
talk will spark new ideas for you and your team. Garrett will draw

harnessed to build better software, faster and with less risk.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-6-1">


<p>
Managing a fleet of servers looks eerily similar to managing complex
software. Embracing immutability in our code can help with
parallelism, improve correctness through invariants, and foster
modularity; I contend those benefits are as important to the practice
of systems administration as they are to writing code.
</p>
<p>
Puppet is an open-source system automation tool. It makes managing
thousands of systems easy by letting users specify invariants about
their infrastructure: they tell Puppet how systems should behave, and
Puppet automatically enforces that behavior. PuppetDB is a centralized
storage system for those invariants. It's written in Clojure, and is
currently in production use at many thousands of datacenters around
the world.
</p>
<p>
In this talk, I will discuss a few major topics: the concept of
"immutable infrastructure" and how PuppetDB helps users express
complex invariants about their systems, how PuppetDB is internally
architected, the experience of bringing Clojure to a Ruby shop, and
what we've learned from having thousands of non-developers consuming
our Clojure code.

<p>
Data these days: there's a crapton of it, and a lot of it is crap. We
need efficiency, we need resource management, and we need to react to
surprises. Can we get just-in-time processing AND secure error
handling AND a modular flexibility like OO has never seen?
Welcome to a new world of data streaming. You want multiple sources?
You want asynchronous, isolated I/O? You want on-the-fly decisions? We
have it all!
This talk introduces reactive data processing, in Scala. See code that
modifies its flow at runtime. Scalaz-streams (emphasis on the zed)
showcases Scala's confluence of OO+FP with a productively lazy,
reassuringly safe, purely functional style. And modularity! I think
code re-use is overrated, except like this. In this session, be on the
watch for advanced FP patterns disguised in ordinary English. You may
never think about richly decadent type systems the same way again.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-6-4">


<p>
Content is everywhere. When you are creating a website, a web
application, a game or a native mobile app - big or small, you have to
deal with content at some point. Which inevitably has you asking
questions: where do I store content? How can I modify texts? Fix
typos, evolve and expand my work?
Traditionally, the industry's answer to these questions has been to
adopt a Content Management System. This answer is particularly
dissatisfying, not only because of the inherent limitations of
available CMS's offerings, but because there is a fundamental problem
with the concept of a CMS: it has the wrong focus, and it does too
many things. Imposing a traditional CMS has inevitably big negative
implications on developers and designers' productivity and tools.
For solving content management challenges, we need to approach the
problem differently. Writing-wroom &amp; Content Delivery API is a new
approach to the problem. This talk will go through the different
content management challenges, and will introduce the 10 fundamentals
for addressing these challenges in a Writing-wroom &amp; Content Delivery
API platform:
</p><ul>
<li>Structured Content with a comfy text and media editor
</li>
<li>Versioning and changes tracking
</li>
<li>Release oriented and previews
</li>
<li>Simplified collaboration workflow

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-7-1">


<p>
A language integrated query allows developers to query data using the
native language syntax. An implementation called LINQ was first
introduced by Microsoft into its .NET framework and later adapted to
other languages, like Slick in Scala, and now Ecto in Elixir.
In its current iteration, Ecto allows developers to query relational
databases using Elixir features to guarantee your queries are fast,
secure and type safe.
This talk will give a quick introduction to Ecto and its main
components while discussing the design decisions behind the library.
Discussing Ecto is a great opportunity to see the use of many Elixir
features in practice like macros, providing the foundation for the
Ecto syntax, and protocols, which guarantees our queries expressions
are extensible and composable.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-7-2">


<p>
Your company has servers distributed around the world and you need to
process data in a centralised location. The data is produced by
applications using different technology stacks and comes from various
sources, from web servers to sensors. How could you solve this
problem? Enter RabbitMQ.
</p>
<p>
In this talk we are going to show how to build a system that can
ingest data produced at separate geo located areas (think AWS and it's
many regions) and replicate it to a central cluster where it can be
further processed and analysed.
</p>
<p>
We will present an example of how to build a system like this one by
using RabbitMQ Federation to replicate data across AWS Regions and
RabbitMQ support for many protocols to produce/consume data.
</p>
<p>
To help with scalability we are going to show an interesting way to
implement sharded queues with RabbitMQ by using the Consistent Hash
Exchange.
</p>
<p>
If you want to learn what else has RabbitMQ to offer beyond simple
messaging and queueing, then this is the talk for you.
</p>
<p>
Talk objectives:
Our goal is to show that over the years RabbitMQ has gone way beyond a
"simple" AMQP server to be able to have federated brokers, HA queues
and support for many protocols and languages.
</p>
<p>
Target audience:
</p><ul>
<li>Developers interested in building a data ingestion platform that
  spans many locations across the world.

</li>
<li>Developers that have built these kind of solutions already but are
  interested in learning about alternatives.

Syntax Matters - What Programmers can learn from the World of
Linguistics
</p>
<p>
Syntax tends to get people unusually upset in the programming world.
Heck, virtually any introductory talk on Erlang (Haskell, Clojure,
whatever) invariably contains a self-deprecatory quote about the
syntax. The thing people forget is that this isn't new. Syntax has
been upsetting hominids since the first australopithecus said "Urghk"
instead of "Oook" - getting thumped for its pains - and has continued
to the present day (Look up "French is better than" on The Googles)
</p>
<p>
In this talk, I will explore the similarities between spoken and
programming languages, with particular emphasis on the process of
learning them, as well as the almost reflexive hatred of this process
in most cultures. You'll learn to appreciate the role of syntax in
languages, how it can help - or hinder! - your understanding of the
semantics, and most importantly, how to appreciate syntax as an
element of the language that is valuable in its own right.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-8-2">


<p>
In the past several years, newsrooms have enthusiastically embraced
dynamic, object-oriented languages such as Ruby and Python. The
traditional wisdom tells that these flexible, forgiving languages have
allowed for fast iteration because there's no compiling, there's a
simple mapping between the "things" in the code (objects) and the
"things" of the news report, and the syntaxes and environments are
friendly to novices. Recently, though, at the New York Times, we have
begun to take a synthetic approach to our app-making. While keeping
the presentation and app-code in Ruby and Javascript, we have begun to
shift some of the analysis and processing work to Haskell. This allows
us to be more flexible, the speed and multi-core optimizations of
Haskell letting us iterate and test more fine-tunings on larger data
without ever leaving our laptops. This talk will focus on the
successes and failures of both trying to start a cultural shift in the
newsroom to accept Haskell as not-just-an-oddball-novelty and trying
to create these synthetic apps with Haskell at their core. The talk
will cover our fashion fingerprint visual analysis of fashion week,
the various Twitter projects in which we used Haskell to analyze
trends in reader tweets, and a forthcoming project in which Haskell is
used to pore over our entire collection of book reviews.

Erlang was tuned to writing distributed, concurrent systems and as
such it has a set of core primivites for doing exactly that.
</p>
<p>
However, it falls short performance wise when it comes to dealing with
compute intensive problems due to the lack of floating point numeric
operations within the VM and lack of GPU awareness. Another problem is
that when you are playing a game of threads you have to manually spawn
and manage processes, which can become unwieldly.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-9-2">


<p>
Lispers, Haskellers, and other functional programmers have long
claimed superiority of their languages for writing meta programs, such
as interpreters. However, any experienced Prolog programmer knows
meta-programming techniques which put Clojure, Scheme, and Haskell to
shame. In this talk we will demonstrate the use of Prolog-style
meta-interpreters in miniKanren, for introspection, monitoring and
debugging, and more.
</p>
<p>
Talk objectives:
</p><ul>
<li>To introduce functional programmers to a powerful form of
  meta-programming largely unknown outside of logic programming
  circles.

Target audience:
</p><ul>
<li>Anyone interested in logic programming! Knowledge of functional

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-10-1">


<p>
The process of software maintenance starts just after the very first
bits of code have been written. Lets face it, very few of us enjoy
chasing bugs, trying to make sense out of tagliatelle code, finding
inconsistencies in how things are built, fixing the same bug in 50
different places due to copy-paste-coding, not feeling confident in
our own modifications due to sub-par tests and having none or broken
documentation. As a software project grows, and time passes, it is
very common for bugs to be harder to find, changes to be harder to
make, and new features harder to integrate. Sounds painfully familiar?
Don't worry, in this talk we'll explore ways of dealing with these
issue before they even become a problem.

<p>
Over the past couple of years we have seen F# gradually being adopted
across the software industry. Whilst that adoption has been largely
centred around the financial industry, F# on its own is an incredibly
versatile and expressive language and enables you to solve a wide
array of problems succinctly and efficiently.
This talk illustrates, with real examples, how the GameSys social team
is using F# to build the backend services that supports around 1
million Daily Active Users (DAU) across its social games on both
mobile and web platforms.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-1">


<p>
Idris is an experimental functional programming language with full
spectrum dependent types, meaning that types can be predicated on any
value. Its syntax is influenced by Haskell. As well as full dependent
types it supports records, type classes, tactic based theorem proving,
totality checking, and an optimising compiler with a foreign function
interface. One of the goals of the Idris project is to bring
type-based program verification techniques to programming
practitioners while still supporting efficient systems programming via
an optimising compiler and interaction with external libraries.
</p>
<p>
Talk objectives:
</p><ul>
<li>The main objective is to explain why software correctness,
  particularly non-functional correctness, is important, and show how
  modern expressive type systems can support this without imposing too
  much burden on application developers.

<p>
Target audience:
</p><ul>
<li>Practitioners interested in verification of non-functional
  properties (particularly resource usage such as files, memory,
  network protocols, etc). Familiarity with a functional programming
  language such as Haskell or F# will be useful, but will not be
  assumed.

concepts, the rest of the talk will be live code. The coding will
begin by showing simple Scala / Akka code to connect to RabbitMQ to
send and receive messages&ndash;think "java.lang.String" values back and
forth to start with. We will then increase the complexity of the
messages and marshal the messages into JSON. Jan will then show the

component by native code in C++: we will write image processing
component. To make matters even better&ndash;faster&ndash;we will then use CUDA
to perform the image processing.

<p>
They say that wisdom comes with age. Like many concepts in software,
we have an imperfect proxy here. Age being the imperfect proxy for
experience, discovery, and learning. When pushing a technology to the
limits of performance one has a lot to learn and then unlearn over
time as the language, runtime, operating systems, and hardware
evolves.
Martin will reflect on his experience with building high performance
systems and how it has impacted his appreciation for different design
approaches and programming paradigms.
Starting with building financial GUIs in the early 90s, then the era
of Servlets and J2EE, streaming data and media concurrently to
thousands of devices, processing and indexing the largest
catalogues,LMAX and the Disruptor, and the current generation of
low-latency trading applications that must cope with millions of
events per second with latency measured in the microseconds. The talk
will cover the major steps in the evolution of Java and how it
contrasts to alternative technologies.
We will also cover the challenges of pushing the limits of performance
and how we need to collaborate with industry experts and organise our
teams, which often stands at odds with the development culture in many
industries and organisations.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-2-2">


<p>
Rust is a new programming language for developing reliable and
efficient systems. It is designed to support concurrency and
parallelism in building platforms that take full advantage of modern
hardware. Its static type system is safe and expressive and it
provides strong guarantees about isolation, concurrency execution and
memory safety.
Rust combines powerful and flexible modern programming constructs with
a clear performance model to make program efficiency predictable and
manageable. One important way it achieves this is by allowing
fine-grained control over memory allocation through contiguous records
and stack allocation. This control is balanced with the absolute
requirement of safety: Rust’s type system and runtime guarantee the
absence of data races, buffer overflow, stack overflow or access to
uninitialized or deallocated memory.
</p>
<p>
Talk objectives:
</p><ul>
<li>Provide an overview of Rust, as well as examples of how its static
  type system ensures stronger compile-time guarantees than that
  provided by C/C++ compilers

</li>
<li>Describe how Rust supports a mixture of imperative procedural,
  concurrent actor-based, object-oriented and functional styles of
  programming.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-3-2">


<p>
The term "programming language" is often used to describe the medium
we use to build software. However, to what extent can we also consider
programming languages as interfaces in their own right? Are they
sufficiently expressive, interactive and dynamic to, say, control a
musical instrument? What if the programming language was the musical
instrument? How might that challenge our perception of programming
language and tools in general. For example, what happens when we
consider the act of programming as a performance? What might a music
programming environment which has sufficient liveness, rapid feedback
and tolerance of failure look like? What benefits would such a style
of programming offer business? Could live coding be beneficial for
rapid prototyping, exploring big data sets, and even communicating
formal business ideas?

<h4 id="sec-5-3-3">Tutorial: Google Go - Fast, Lean, Scalable and Fun</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-3-3">


<p>
This tutorial will explore Google Go with an emphasis on writing the
kind of high-productivity code which is typical of dynamically typed
languages whilst retaining the precise control over runtime
performance and resource usage that static type checking enables.
</p>
<p>
The treatment will be divided into several sections, starting with an
introduction to Go's standard toolchain and basic semantics, including
testing and benchmarking. We'll then venture deeper into Go's type
system, memory model and CSP-based concurrency.
</p>
<p>
Along the way we'll meet the distinction between reference and value
types, slices and maps, and the user-defined types which form the
basis of Go's object model. This will lead naturally to Go's interface
types and the method-based type inference which forms the basis of
duck typing.
</p>
<p>
We'll complete our coverage of Go's type system by studying
first-class functions, closures and goroutines along with the CSP
concurrency model they support. This will demonstrate that Go is a
powerful general purpose programming language suited to writing
flexible, scalable, maintainable applications for modern multi-core
and distributed environments.
</p>
<p>
Next we'll discuss integrating Go code with existing dynamic libraries
written in C and at how to directly incorporate C and assembly
language at compile time.
</p>
<p>
During the course of the tutorial examples will be drawn from a
variety of topics including virtual machine implementation, iterators
and advanced memory manipulation.
</p>
<p>
By the end of the tutorial you should have a reasonable grasp of how
Go stacks up for real-world development and a firm foundation from
which to explore further.

Going Loopy: Iteration in Go
</p>
<p>
Talk Abstract:
</p>
<p>
Go is a statically compiled systems programming language aimed at
C/C++ developers which draws its inspiration from the low-ceremony of
popular dynamic languages. It is very easy to learn and particularly
well-suited to implementing concurrency.
</p>
<p>
Talk Objectives:
</p>
<p>
In this session we'll learn the basic syntax and semantics of the
language by examining the flexible for{} construct, starting with the
most basic C-like forms and building through type assertion, closures,
channels and reflection to demonstrate the basics of generalised
iteration. Testing and benchmarking will also be covered, imparting
sufficient knowledge to begin using the language for practical
development.

This talk is suitable for moderately experienced developers and does
not require any familiarity with Go.
